## 🔄 OMG Premium TV Changelog

### 🚀 Version 7.0.0 (Current)

### ✨ New Features
- **🔒 Home password protection**: Option in the web UI to protect access to the configuration page with a password. When enabled, anyone opening the home (or the "Configure" link from Stremio) must enter the password; using the addon from Stremio does not require a password.
- **🔄 Sessions and isolated cache**: Cache is automatically isolated per configuration (same config = same cache). EPG, Python Resolver, and Playlist Generator are also per-session. Multiple users or different configurations can use the server at the same time without overwriting each other's data.
- **🆔 Session ID**: The **Session ID** (derived from the configuration) is shown on the home/config page when you generate a configuration. The ID is also included in backup (export) and updated on restore (import).
- **⏰ Session expiry (24h)**: If a session receives no requests for **24 hours**, it expires automatically: all cache for that session (M3U cache, EPG, resolver, generator) is removed. On the next request with the same config, the session is recreated and data is repopulated from the URLs.

### 🔧 Improvements
- **⚙️ Settings section**: The catalog has a **⚙️** genre filter that groups utility channels: **Refresh M3U playlist**, **Refresh EPG**, and **Regenerate Python playlist**. Descriptions and messages are in English.
- **🔄 Pseudo-channels**: Opening a channel from the ⚙️ section runs the action (reload playlist, EPG update, or Python regeneration) and shows an outcome message; no real video stream.
- **♻️ Cache on restart**: If the cache is empty (e.g. after a Docker restart), the playlist and EPG are rebuilt automatically on the first request when M3U/EPG URLs are configured.
- **📺 EPG and channel IDs**: Improved EPG matching for channels with suffixes (e.g. `canale5.it` / `canale5`).
- **🔒 Home protection UI**: When protection is active you see the checkbox and a "Modifica password" (Change password) button; password and confirm fields only appear when you click it.
- **🔗 Return after login**: After entering the password on the gate you are redirected back to the page you came from (e.g. configuration page with encoded URL).

### 🚀 Version 6.0.0

### 📢 Name Rebrand
- **📜 OMG+ becomes OMG Premium**: New name to differentiate and highlight all the new available functions. OMG TV remains as the basic version with preset channels. It will no longer be updated.

- **🔄 Regeneration Channel**: New channel in the ~SETTINGS~ category to regenerate the playlist without accessing the web panel
